Project Overview: The Employee Distribution Report project involved comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and analysis in MySQL, followed by data visualization using Power BI. The objective was to provide insights into various aspects of the company's workforce.

Key Questions Explored:
1.	What is the gender distribution among employees in the company?
2.	What is the breakdown of race/ethnicity among employees?
3.	How is the age distributed across the employee demographic?
4.	What is the distribution of employees between headquarters and remote locations?
5.	What is the average length of employment for terminated employees?
6.	How does gender distribution vary across different departments and job titles?
7.	What is the overall distribution of job titles within the company?
8.	Which department exhibits the highest turnover rate?
9.	What is the geographical distribution of employees across different states?
10.	How has the company's employee count evolved over time based on hire and termination dates?
11.	What is the tenure distribution for each department?

Summary of Key Findings:
1.	Male employees outnumber female employees.
2.	The majority of employees identify as White, while Native Hawaiian and American Indian demographics are less represented.
3.	Employees' ages range from 20 to 57 years, with a concentration in the 25-34 age group.
4.	Headquarters have a higher number of employees compared to remote locations.
5.	Terminated employees, on average, had a tenure of approximately 7 years.
6.	Gender distribution across departments is balanced, with a general male predominance.
7.	The Marketing department experiences the highest turnover rate, followed by Training, while Research and Development, Support, and Legal exhibit the lowest turnover rates.
8.	A significant proportion of employees originates from the state of Ohio.
9.	The overall employee count has increased over the years.
10.	The average tenure for each department is approximately 8 years, with Legal and Auditing having the highest, and Services, Sales, and Marketing having the lowest.

Limitations of the Analysis:
1.	Records with negative ages (967 records) were excluded from the analysis; ages considered were 18 years and above.
2.	Term dates far into the future (1599 records) were not included in the analysis; only term dates less than or equal to the current date were considered.
3.	The map visual should be used for the Employees Distribution by States, however as map visual was not workable for my Power BI, I had to use the column chart instead.
